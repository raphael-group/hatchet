# plot-bins

This step produces informative plots concerning the computed RDRs, BAFs, and clusters.
The information produced by this step are important to validate the compute clusters of genomic regions and help to tune the parameters for better deal with special datasets.
cluster-bins produces different plots which need to be specified by different commands and require different input.

## Input

plot-bins considers two different inputs which are tab-separated files, one is mandatory and the other is only required for certain command:

1. A file of clustered genomic bins, specified without any flag and with the following fields.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `CHR` | Name of a chromosome |
| `START` | Starting genomic position of a genomic bin in `CHR` |
| `END` | Ending genomic position of a genomic bin in `CHR` |
| `SAMPLE` | Name of a tumor sample |
| `RD` | RDR of the bin in `SAMPLE` |
| `#SNPS` | Number of SNPs present in the bin in `SAMPLE` |
| `COV` | Average coverage in the bin in `SAMPLE` |
| `ALPHA` | Alpha parameter related to the binomial model of BAF for the bin in `SAMPLE`, typically total number of reads from A allele |
| `BETA` | Beta parameter related to the binomial model of BAF for the bin in `SAMPLE`, typically total number of reads from B allele |
| `BAF` | BAF of the bin in `SAMPLE` |
| `CLUSTER` | The name of the corresponding cluster of the bin in `SAMPLE` |

2. A file of clusters, which is required only by commands and it is specified through the flag `-s`, `--segfile`. The file has the following fields.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `ID` | The name of a cluster |
| `SAMPLE` | The name of a sample |
| `#BINS` | The number of bins included in `ID` |
| `RD` | The RDR of the cluster `ID` in `SAMPLE` |
| `#SNPS` | The total number of SNPs in the cluster `ID` |
| `COV` | The average coverage in the cluster `ID` |
| `ALPHA` | The alpha parameter of the binomial model for the BAF of the cluster `ID` |
| `BETA` | The beta parameter of the binomial model for the BAF of the cluster `ID` |
| `BAF` | The BAF of the cluster `ID` in `SAMPLE` |

## Commands

A command must be specified using the flag `-c`, `--command` and every command is described in the following together with an example of the corresponding plot.

### RD

The command generates a scatter plot describing the RDR of every genomic bin in the different samples. For every genomic bin sorted by chromosome and by genomic positions, a point is plotted with the correspondig value of RDR and colored by a color identifying the corresponding sample.

    python -m hatchet plot-bins A12.bbc -c RD -m Set1 --figsize 9,2.5 --markersize 1 --ymax 8 --ymin 0

***

### BAF

The command generates a scatter plot describing the BAF of every genomic bin in the different samples. For every genomic bin sorted by chromosome and by genomic positions, a point is plotted with the correspondig value of RDR and colored by a color identifying the corresponding sample.

    python -m hatchet plot-bins A12.bbc -c BAF -m Set1 --figsize 9,2.5 --markersize 1 --ymax 8 --ymin 0

***

### BB

The command generates a series of 2d-scatter plots where x-axis corresponds to the RDR and the y-axis corresponds to 0.5 - BAF. More specifically, a plot is generated for every sample and every point is drawn according to the corresponding values of RDR and BAF. The points are colored according to their density from blue (low density) to dark red (high density).

    python -m hatchet plot-bins A12.bbc -c BB --figsize 8,6 --markersize 1 --xmax 3.5 --xmin 0.5

***

### CBB

The command generates a series of 2d-scatter plots where x-axis corresponds to the RDR and the y-axis corresponds to 0.5 - BAF. More specifically, a plot is generated for every sample and every point is drawn according to the corresponding values of RDR and BAF. The points are colored according to the clusters computed by HATCHet. Remember that a cluster contains all the genomic regions that have the same copy-number state in every clone.

    python -m hatchet plot-bins A12.bbc -c CBB --figsize 4,1.1 -m tab20 --markersize 1 --xmax 3.5 --xmin 0.5 --colwrap 3 -tS 0.005

***

### CRDR

The command generates a series of 2d-scatter plots where x-axis corresponds to the RDR and to bins sorted by chromosome and positions. More specifically, a plot is generated for every sample and every point is drawn according to the corresponding values of RDR. The points are colored according to the clusters computed by HATCHet. Remember that a cluster contains all the genomic regions that have the same copy-number state in every clone.

    python -m hatchet plot-bins A12.bbc -c CRD -m tab20 --figsize 9,2.5 --markersize 1 --ymax 8 --ymin 0

***

### CBAF

The command generates a series of 2d-scatter plots where x-axis corresponds to the BAF and to bins sorted by chromosome and positions. More specifically, a plot is generated for every sample and every point is drawn according to the corresponding values of BAF. The points are colored according to the clusters computed by HATCHet. Remember that a cluster contains all the genomic regions that have the same copy-number state in every clone.

    python -m hatchet plot-bins A12.bbc -c CBAF -m tab20 --figsize 9,2.5 --markersize 1 --ymax 8 --ymin 0
