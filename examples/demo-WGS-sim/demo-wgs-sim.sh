# Demo for standard WGS data 
: ex: set ft=markdown ;:<<'```shell' #

The following HATCHet's demo represents a guided example starting from WGS (whole-genome sequencing) data from 3 simulated samples obtained from the same tumor. This represents an exemplary case of executing HATCHet on a typical dataset with standard noise. For simplicity, the demo starts from a BB file `demo-WGS-sim.bb` (included in this demo at `examples/demo-WGS-sim/`) which contains the RDR and BAF of every genomic bin and, therefore, we assume that the preliminary steps (i.e. count-reads, count-alleles, and combine-counts) have already been executed by running standard configuration for WGS data (bin size of 50kb through -b 50kb of count-reads, and the allele counts for germline heterozygous SNPs have been selected between 3 and 200 through `-c 3 -C 200`).

Specifically, the tumor is composed of 2 tumor clones (clone0 and clone1) and a normal diploid clone (normal). The clonal composition of every sample is described in the following table:

| Name | Proportion of normal clone | Proporion of clone0 | Proportion of clone1 |
|------|----------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| `bulk_035clone1_06clone0_005normal` | `5%` | `60%` | `35%` |
| `bulk_055clone1_04clone0_005normal` | `5%` | `40%` | `55%` |
| `bulk_08clone1_Noneclone0_02normal` | `20%` | Not present | `80%` |

## Requirements and set up

The demo requires that HATCHet has been successfully compiled and all the dependencies are available and functional. As such, the demo requires the user to properly set up the following paths:

```shell
PY="python3" # This id the full path to the version of PYTHON3 which contains the required `hatchet` module. When this corresponds to the standard version, the user can keep the given value of `python3`
:<<'```shell' # Ignore this line
```

The following paths are consequently obtained to point to the required components of HATCHet

```shell
CLUSTERBINS="${PY} -m hatchet cluster-bins"
PLOTBINS="${PY} -m hatchet plot-bins"
INFER="${PY} -m hatchet compute-cn"
PLOTCN="${PY} -m hatchet plot-cn"
:<<'```shell' # Ignore this line
```

We also ask the demo to terminate in case of errors and to print a trace of the execution by the following commands
```shell
set -e
set -o xtrace
PS4='[\t]'
:<<'```shell' # Ignore this line
```

## Global clustering

The first main step of the demo performs the global clustering of HATCHet where genomic bins which have the same copy-number state in every tumor clone are clustered correspondingly. To do this, we use `cluster-bins`, i.e. the HATCHet's component designed for this purpose. At first, we attempt to run the clustering using the default values of the parameters as follows:

```shell
${CLUSTERBINS} demo-wgs-sim.bb -o demo-wgs-sim.seg -O demo-wgs-sim.bbc -e 12 -tB 0.03 -tR 0.15 -d 0.08
:<<'```shell' # Ignore this line
```

To assess the quality of the clustering we generate the cluster plot using the `CBB` command of `plot-bins`, i.e. the HATCHet's component designed for the analysis of the data. For simplicity, we also use the following options
- `--colwrap 3` allows to have the 3 plots of the 3 samples on the same figure row
- `-tS 0.01` asks to plot only the clusters which cover at least the `1%` of the genome. This is useful to clean the figure and focus on the main components.

```shell
${PLOTBINS} -c CBB demo-wgs-sim.bbc --colwrap 3 -tS 0.01
:<<'```shell' # Ignore this line
```

We thus obtain the following clustering:

We can easily notice that the clustering is good and not tuning is needed as every pair of clusters is clearly distinct in one of the two dimensions (RDR and BAF) in **at least one** sample. 

## hatchet's step

Next we apply `hatchet`, i.e. the component of HATCHet which estimates fractional copy numbers, infers allele-and-clone specific copy numbers, and jointly predicts the number of clones (including the normal clone) and the presence of a WGD. 
We apply the last step with default parameters and, for simplicity of this demo, we consider 8 clones, which can be easily considered by HATCHet in this case, and we only consider 100 restarts for the coordinate-descent method; these are the number of attempts to find the best solution. This number is sufficient in this small example but we reccommend to use at least 400 restarts in standard runs.

```shell
${INFER} -i demo-wgs-sim -n2,8 -p 100 -v 2 -u 0.03 -r 12 -eD 6 -eT 12 -l 0.5 |& tee hatchet.log
:<<'```shell' # Ignore this line
```

We obtain the following summary of results:

    ## Diploid with 2 clones - OBJ: 66.884758 - score: -0.17739731674

HATCHet predicts the presence of 3 clones in the 3 tumor samples and, especially, predicts that 2 samples contains two distinct tumor clones, according to the true clonal composition. 

## Analyzing inferred results

Finally, we obtain useful plots to summarize and analyze the inferred results by using `plot-cn`, which is the last component of HATCHet. We run `plot-cn` as follows

```shell
${PLOTCN} best.bbc.ucn
exit $?
```

First, `plot-cn` summarizes the values of tumor purity and tumor ploidy for every sample of the patient as follows:

    ### SAMPLE: bulk_08clone1_Noneclone0_02normal -- PURITY: 0.799477 -- PLOIDY: 3.07107541299 -- CLASSIFICATION: TETRAPLOID
    ### SAMPLE: bulk_035clone1_06clone0_005normal -- PURITY: 0.95065 -- PLOIDY: 3.37447061915 -- CLASSIFICATION: TETRAPLOID
    ### SAMPLE: bulk_055clone1_04clone0_005normal -- PURITY: 0.95048 -- PLOIDY: 3.27575289096 -- CLASSIFICATION: TETRAPLOID

Next, `plot-cn` produces some informative plots to evaluate the inferred results. Among all the plots, 3 of those are particularly interesting.

The first `intratumor-clones-totalcn.pdf` represents the total-copy numbers for all tumor clones in fixed-size regions (obtained by merging neighboring genomic bins).
![intratumor-clones-totalcn.pdf](totalcn.png)
Every tumor clone is identified by a color and a dot is drawn for every genomic region (which are partitioned) for the corresponding total copy number.

The second `intratumor-clones-allelecn.pdf` similarly represents the allele-specific copy numbers (split between the bottom and top regions of the figure) as the plot above.
![intratumor-clones-allelecn.pdf](allelecn.png)

The third `intratumor-profiles.pdf` represents both the clone proportions and the total copy numbers of every clone in genomic regions.
![intratumor-clones-allelecn.pdf](profiles.png)
The main heatmap in the right side of the figure represent the total copy number of every clone (i.e. a row) for every genomic region (which are partition into chromosomes as described at the top of the heatmap) such that grey color indicate regions with base copy number not affected by CNAs (but they can be affected by a WGD when this occurrs), blue colors indicates deletions, and red colors indicate amplifications; in general, the stronger the color the smaller/higher the corresponding aberration. The smaller heatmap in the left side describes the clone proportion of each clone in each sample such that the lightest color correspond to absence while darker colors indicate higher clone proportions. Last, in the left-most part there is a dendogram which hierarchically clusters the tumor clones based on similiraity.
