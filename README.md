# HATCHet2

HATCHet2 is an algorithm to infer allele and clone-specific copy-number aberrations (CNAs), clone proportions, and whole-genome duplications (WGD) for several tumor clones jointly from multiple bulk-tumor samples of the same patient or from a single bulk-tumor sample.

Complete documentation for HATCHet2 is available at [https://raphael-group.github.io/hatchet/](https://raphael-group.github.io/hatchet/)
