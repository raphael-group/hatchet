# HATCHet

HATCHet is an algorithm to infer allele and clone-specific copy-number aberrations (CNAs), clone proportions, and whole-genome duplications (WGD) for several tumor clones jointly from multiple bulk-tumor samples of the same patient or from a single bulk-tumor sample.

Complete documentation for HATCHet is available at [http://compbio.cs.brown.edu/hatchet/](http://compbio.cs.brown.edu/hatchet/)
